#Then, concatenate everything into a string within a print() statement with the form "So your name is [name], your quest is [quest], and your favorite color is [color]."

var1 = input("what is your name? ")
var2 = input("what is your quest? ")
var3 = input("what is your favorite color? ")
print("So your name is " + var1 + ", your quest is " +var2+ ", and your favorite color is " + var3)
